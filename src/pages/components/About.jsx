        <h2>Welcome to Gift Delight</h2>
    <p>Gifts's delight  is simply our take on traditional African and inDIAN cuisine balanced with healthy, culinary twists. Inspired by home-style cooking infused with the warmth and vibrancy of Africans culture and people, Gift Delight is a celebration of our love and respect for the African and Indian food and all the amazing cooks we know. We even chose a traditional/Western nickname for the restaurant, one that represents that good tummy feeling you get after having a delicious home-cooked meal.
